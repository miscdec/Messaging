# Messaging
This is the [stock SMS app from AOSP](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Messaging/),
configured as an Android Studio project so that it can be built *without having to download and compile all of AOSP*.

## This project is available for transfer...
... provided that you also accept transfer of the app in Play (_although the app is unpublished at Play, Google does not
let me remove it because of active installations_). If you agree, send a message to alper.goplay@gmail.com with your transaction ID
and developer ID, transfer at Play will be performed first, then Github.
